# Universal Pitch Deck Guide

A single reference for all MDx Vision decks - investor, sales, military, and capability statements.

---

## Core Principles

### The 3-30-3 Rule (Modern Standard)
| Time | What Happens | Your Deck Must... |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| **3 seconds** | First glance | Have a clear, compelling title slide |
| **30 seconds** | Quick skim | Tell a coherent story through headlines alone |
| **3 minutes** | Deep dive | Deliver complete value proposition |

### Guy Kawasaki's 10/20/30 (Adapted)
Original rule: 10 slides, 20 minutes, 30pt font minimum.

**Modern adaptation:**
- **Slides**: 8-12 for most decks (attention spans shorter)
- **Time**: 5-10 minutes for pitch, 15-20 for detailed sales
- **Font**: 24pt minimum body text, 36pt+ headlines
- **Mobile**: Deck must be readable on phone

### The Investor Reality
- Average time reviewing a deck: **2 minutes 41 seconds**
- 90% of investors decide in the **first 3 slides**
- Decisions often made before financial slides

## Deck Types

### 1. Investor Deck
**Purpose**: Sell the company and team
**Length**: 10-12 slides max
**Focus**: Market opportunity, traction, team

**Required Slides**:
1. Title (company + one-line value prop)
2. Problem (pain point, market gap)
3. Solution (your product, demo if possible)
4. Market Size (TAM/SAM/SOM with sources)
5. Business Model (how you make money)
6. Traction (revenue, users, pilots, LOIs)
7. Competition (positioning matrix, not "no competitors")
8. Team (relevant experience, why you win)
9. Financials (projections, unit economics)
10. The Ask (amount, use of funds, milestones)
11. Contact/Appendix

### 2. Sales Deck (Healthcare B2B)
**Purpose**: Sell the product to buyers
**Length**: 12-15 slides
**Focus**: ROI, workflow integration, compliance

**Required Slides**:
1. Title
2. The Challenge (their pain, not yours)
3. The Solution (problem→solution mapping)
4. How It Works (3-4 step workflow)
5. Key Features (benefits, not specs)
6. Integration (EHR compatibility)
7. Compliance (HIPAA, SOC 2, security)
8. Use Cases (2-4 relevant scenarios)
9. Social Proof (case studies, testimonials)
10. ROI/Outcomes (time saved, revenue gained)
11. Pricing/Packages (if appropriate)
12. Next Steps (pilot, demo, trial)
13. Contact

**Healthcare-Specific**:
- Know your stakeholder: CFO cares about ROI, CMO about quality, IT about integration
- Lead with evidence (studies, metrics)
- Address HIPAA/security early
- Understand CapEx vs OpEx timing (budget cycles)
- Be specific about EHR integration (Epic, Cerner, etc.)

### 3. Sales Deck (Military/Government)
**Purpose**: Demonstrate capability for procurement
**Length**: 8-12 slides
**Focus**: Mission capability, security, compliance

**Required Slides**:
1. Title (include contract vehicles if applicable)
2. The Challenge (operational gap)
3. The Solution (direct problem→solution)
4. Technical Capabilities
5. Security/Compliance (IL4/IL5, ITAR if relevant)
6. Hardware/Specifications
7. Use Cases (mission-specific)
8. Past Performance (if any)
9. Contact (include CAGE code, DUNS)

**Government-Specific**:
- Subject matter experts > sales pitch
- Be factual, skip marketing speak
- Compliance is non-negotiable (don't fluff it)
- Consider prime contractor partnerships
- SBIR/STTR eligibility if applicable
- Understand contracting vehicles (GSA, SEWP, etc.)

### 4. Capability Statement
**Purpose**: One-page procurement qualification
**Length**: 1 page (two-sided max)
**Focus**: Quick reference for contracting officers

**Required Sections**:
- Company Overview (2-3 sentences)
- Core Competencies (3-5 bullet points)
- Differentiators (what makes you unique)
- Past Performance (2-3 examples)
- Company Data (CAGE, DUNS, NAICS, certifications)
- Contact Information

## Standalone vs Presentation Decks

### Standalone Deck (Email/Read-Ahead)
**Viewer reads without you there.**

- Must be self-explanatory
- Include explanatory text (not just bullet points)
- No "I'll explain this" slides
- Executive summary at the start
- Appendix with details
- PDF format, optimized for screen

### Presentation Deck (Live Pitch)
**You're in the room to explain.**

- Minimal text (you provide the narrative)
- Visual-first slides
- Build reveals for complex info
- Speaker notes for your reference
- High-contrast for projector/screen

### Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
Create a standalone version that can also be presented:
- Headlines carry the story
- Subtext provides detail for readers
- Visuals support both modes
- Works for email and live pitch

## Common Mistakes (Anti-Patterns)

### 1. Information Overload
**Wrong**: 15 bullet points per slide, walls of text
**Right**: One idea per slide, minimal text

### 2. Features Over Benefits
**Wrong**: "40GB storage, HD camera, Bluetooth 5.0"
**Right**: "Capture 8 hours of documentation without charging"

### 3. Ignoring Competition
**Wrong**: "We have no competitors"
**Right**: "Here's how we're positioned vs. alternatives"

### 4. Generic Slides
**Wrong**: "Deployment Timeline: Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3"
**Right**: Remove generic slides entirely, or make them specific

### 5. Mismatched Problems/Solutions
**Wrong**: Problem says "paperwork burden" → Solution shows "language translation"
**Right**: Each problem has a corresponding solution

### 6. Counting Errors
**Wrong**: "Our Top 7 Features" (shows 6 features)
**Right**: Count your items before publishing

### 7. Unverified Stats
**Wrong**: "10M+ patient encounters" (no source)
**Right**: Use stats you can prove, or remove them

### 8. Too Many Use Cases
**Wrong**: 6 use cases (including filler like "Training")
**Right**: 3-4 strong, specific use cases

### 9. Missing the Ask
**Wrong**: End with generic "Contact Us"
**Right**: Specific ask: "Schedule a pilot" or "Invest $2M"

### 10. Overcomplicated Visuals
**Wrong**: 3D charts, unnecessary animations, stock photos
**Right**: Simple charts, real product images, clean icons
